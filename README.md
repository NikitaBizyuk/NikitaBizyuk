## üß† About Me

I'm passionate about building projects from the ground up ‚Äî from the frontend to the backend, the database, and the security layers in between. I enjoy the full spectrum of software engineering, systems design, and cybersecurity, and I'm constantly eager to expand my skills and tackle new challenges.

Whether it's designing secure systems, implementing backend logic, crafting intuitive UIs, or analyzing how software can be hardened against threats, I love learning and building.
